## Topic
Popularity Prediction of Article Online

## Description
Target :<br/> 
An article from the Internet is going to be given, and we look forward to the prediction of its popularity online *(including hits, likes, and shares)*.<br/>
<br/>
Implementation Summary : 
1. Find some useful dataset
2. Choose the suitable attributes
3. Build the Random Decision Forests to achieve our goal
   - Use the chosen attributes as the decision nodes
   - We will try other algorithms or models to obtain better performance<br/>
4. We need to find the useful NLP model to process the articles to abstract the attributes we want
   
Questions We Think We May Face : 
- We have difficulty in fetching the capable dataset.
- There may be some ambiguous attributes we are not able to determine.
- The accuracy may not reach our expectation.
